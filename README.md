# SmartHome
  Smart Home Project – ODC AMIT Embedded Systems Program I’m excited to share my Smart Home Project that I developed during my internship at the Orange Digital Center (ODC) as part of the AMIT Embedded Systems Program. This project, based on FreeRTOS, focused on creating a secure and automated environment using various hardware and software components. 💻 Hardware Components:  Atmega32 microcontroller  Bluetooth Module  EEPROM for storing user credentials  Alarm (simple buzzer)  LCD Display  LM35 Temperature Sensor  Door Lock for controlled access  🛠️ Software Components:  Login Task:  Function 1: Creates new user credentials and stores them in EEPROM.  Function 2: Authenticates user input. If the credentials match, the system and door lock are opened. After three incorrect password attempts, the system locks and triggers the alarm.  Temperature Monitoring Task:  Reads data from the LM35 sensor and sends it to the fan control task.  Fan Control Task:  Adjusts fan speed based on the temperature readings for optimal comfort. 🔒 Security Features:  Three Attempt Lockout: After three failed password attempts, the system locks and triggers the alarm.
